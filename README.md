# 🎨 Hard Coded ASCII Art – Tite Kubo

A large-scale ASCII art rendering project written in Python that generates a detailed 50x50 console-based portrait of Tite Kubo using character mapping and coordinate-based logic.

This project contains 2130+ lines of structured conditional logic to manually construct high-resolution ASCII art output directly in the terminal.

## 🖼 Preview

Run the script to generate a full ASCII portrait in your console.

## 🚀 Features

- 50x50 grid-based ASCII rendering
- Fully hard-coded coordinate logic
- Nested loop matrix structure
- Complex conditional branching for character placement
- Console-based visual rendering
- 2130+ lines of detailed pattern control

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Nested loops
- Conditional statements
- Grid-based coordinate logic
- Console output formatting

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The program:

1. Creates a 50x50 virtual grid using nested loops.
2. Uses coordinate-based conditions (`i` and `j` indices).
3. Prints specific characters based on pixel positions.
4. Reconstructs the portrait entirely through logical placement.

Each character acts like a pixel in a console-based rendering system.
